# The provided code stub reads two integers from STDIN,  a and b. Add code to print three lines where:

# 1. The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
# 2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
# 3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

# Example

# a = 3
# b = 5


# Print the following:

# 8
# -2
# 15

    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    print(a + b)
    print(a - b)
    print(a * b)
